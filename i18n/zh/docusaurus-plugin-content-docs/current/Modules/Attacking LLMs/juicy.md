# Juicy

## Task 1 Juicy

Meet **Juicy**, a lively golden retriever with a habit of wandering from room to room. She's friendly, curious, and absolutely terrible at keeping out of places she shouldn't be. Whenever her owner is on a call, typing away, or talking about something that ought to stay private, Juicy somehow ends up nearby; ears perked up, tail wagging, and absorbing every word.

Juicy isn't supposed to repeat what she has heard, and the owner keeps a close eye on every message you send to her. Anything suspicious or too direct might raise an eyebrow, so you'll need to be subtle, creative, and patient if you want to retrieve the information she's holding on to.

Using AttackBox or your own VM with the VPN connected, start the challenge here:

Note: You'll be interacting with a live LLM behind the scenes. Behaviour might vary between attempts, responses may shift slightly, and part of the challenge is adapting your approach as Juicy reacts to what you say.
