# Starters

A collection of fun independent challenges that should not be overlooked.

This module offers a collection of fun, standalone CTF-style challenges designed to help learners build practical hacking skills. These are not part of a linear learning path but serve as valuable, varied practice for foundational techniques across different domains.
