# Modules

Modules are made up of bite-sized labs.

## [Command Line](Command%20Line/index.md)

> Understanding command-line interfaces (CLI) is essential, as many security tools and tasks require their configuration and usage through them. CLIs are imperative for scripting and automation and can prove very helpful in carrying out penetration testing and incident analysis. This module will teach us how to use the command line and PowerShell in Windows and Bash in Linux.

## [Container Security](Container%20Security/index.md)

> Containerisation technologies such as Docker are popular for developing and deploying applications. In this module, you will learn how Docker works, some common vulnerabilities and various measures that can be taken to secure your container from attack.

## [Host Evasions](Host%20Evasions/index.md)

> This module provides the essential knowledge and fundamental techniques to bypass various host-based security solutions, including AV products, UAC and AppLocker, Logging, Runtime Detection, and AMSI. You will also learn the Living-Off-the-Land technique and how to leverage the Windows Sysinternals tool to perform various Red Team purposes.

## [Microsoft Defender XDR](Microsoft%20Defender%20XDR/index.md)

> Microsoft Defender XDR is built to correlate threat signals across endpoints, identities, email, and cloud apps. This module walks you through the attacker kill chain step-by-step, helping you understand how different stages of an attack surface in Defender tools. Across the module, you'll investigate alerts and signals related to Initial Access, Privilege Escalation, Lateral Movement, and more. By working through real-world scenarios, you'll develop hands-on experience with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Identity, building the skills needed to detect, investigate, and respond to complex threats using XDR.
