# Modules

Modules are made up of bite-sized labs.

## [Command Line](Command%20Line/index.md)

> Understanding command-line interfaces (CLI) is essential, as many security tools and tasks require their configuration and usage through them. CLIs are imperative for scripting and automation and can prove very helpful in carrying out penetration testing and incident analysis. This module will teach us how to use the command line and PowerShell in Windows and Bash in Linux.

## [Container Security](Container%20Security/index.md)

> Containerisation technologies such as Docker are popular for developing and deploying applications. In this module, you will learn how Docker works, some common vulnerabilities and various measures that can be taken to secure your container from attack.
